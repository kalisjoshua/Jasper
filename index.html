          <h3>The Problem</h3>
          
          <p>I don't like most interview questions.</p>

          <ul>
            <li>What is your biggest weakness?</li>
            <li>Why are manhole covers round?</li>
            <li>Talk about a time when you failed.</li>
          </ul>

          <p>I think interviews for front-end developers are broken. Questions are asked and stories are told; the truthy-ness of those stories is completely up to the interpretation of the interviewers. Wouldn't it be better to simply work with the candidate for a while and get "real" experience with that person?</p>

          <h3>This Solution</h3>
          
          <p>Jasper attempts to fix this problem by providing a tool for use in various ways. One way to use Jasper is to include it on a website as an easter-egg to be found by developers. People like to find things and most people like a challenge; developers especially will rise to a challenge to prove their skill. Another way to use Jasper is to include it in an interview where a candidate and another person - or two - can work through the challenges presented. By doing "real" work with someone, you may be able to get a better feel for how working with them might actually be once they are hired.</p>

          <p>I think interviews should involve some typical every-day stuff. I think that this would help the candidate relax a little since it should be an activity they are completely comfortable with.</p>

          <p>The Jasper challenges progressively increase in difficulty.</p>
