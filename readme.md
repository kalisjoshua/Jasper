# Jasper [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/kalisjoshua/Jasper.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/kalisjoshua/Jasper)

Jasper provides an API, and engine, to cycle through challenges that will hopefully help identify areas of knowledge or learning opportunities in the user. The challenges are designed to increase in difficulty (or obscurity) as you answer more.

 **Demo: http://kalisjoshua.github.io/Jasper/**

I hope to add on to this library with some useful features:

  * Tracking correct / incorrect answers and reporting to a backend
  * When complete, providing a hash ID for submission with resumes
  * Scoring with questions that have difficulty rankings
  * Intentional holes in security for hacking

# How to contribute / build 

Unit tests are executed by Karma with Jasmine framework.

You will need NodeJS (at least 0.8) then you have 2 solutions :

- Install Karma globally with 
```
npm install -g karma
```

then run with ```karma start```

- Juste run ```npm install``` then ```npm test```
