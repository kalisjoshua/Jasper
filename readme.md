# Jasper [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/kalisjoshua/Jasper.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/kalisjoshua/Jasper)

Jasper provides an API, and engine, to cycle through challenges that will hopefully help identify areas of knowledge or learning opportunities in the user. The challenges are designed to increase in difficulty (or obscurity) as you answer more.

 **Demo: http://kalisjoshua.github.io/Jasper/**

I hope to add on to this library with some useful features:

  * Tracking correct / incorrect answers and reporting to a backend
  * When complete, providing a hash ID for submission with resumes
  * Scoring with questions that have difficulty rankings
  * Intentional holes in security for hacking
